title: In the footsteps of an intermediary between prokaryotes and eukaryotes
category: Intermediary between prokaryotes and eukaryotes
---
Although very different in their organization with or without internal membrane networks, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells share many characteristics. Their operation is based on the same chemical bases (DNA, RNA, proteins, ATP, etc.) and they use the same metabolic pathways. This suggests a kinship between all the cells in the present biosphere. Under these conditions, is it possible to currently find organisms on earth that would present intermediate characteristics, that is to say prokaryotes with internal compartmentalisation or eukaryotes devoid of organelles?
