## Introduction
Like the mitochondria, the plastids of photosynthetic eukaryotes, algae and plants, most likely derive from an endosymbiosis: that of a cyanobacterium with a eukaryotic cell already possessing mitochondria, to give what is called an [alga]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/history_of_classification/sections/definitions.html#algae). However, the history of plastids is much more complex than that of mitochondria, as there appear to have been at least two independent initial endosymbioses. In addition, one of the two was followed by additional symbioses, where eukaryotic algae will in turn act as endosymbiosis partners to give rise to new lineages of algae. We talk about the event of initial cyanobacterial endosymbiosis called primary endosymbiosis. The other endosymbioses are termed secondary, even in certain cases tertiary or quaternary! The main argument supporting these assertions is similar to that of mitochondrial endosymbiosis: the plastids from primary endosymbiosis resemble photosynthetic bacteria having degenerated, and those from secondary endosymbiosis to eukaryotic algae having degenerated.

<br>
## Primary endosymbioses
Plastids from primary endosymbioses have two membranes and have a genome which codes, among other things, for subunits of photosynthetic complexes. Among the different lineages resulting from primary endosymbiosis, one, that of [Glaucophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#glaucophyta) (Figure 34) even contains plastids, called cyanelles in these organisms, which have conserved peptidoglycan between their two membranes and the photosynthetic pigments typical of cyanobacteria! Comparisons of the genomes of plastids from primary endosymbiosis with those of bacteria (Figure 35) show that they are related with the cyanobacterial genomes of group A and that all have a common origin, except the plastid present in Paulinellida "_Paulinella chromatophora_" which is related to cyanobacteria of the C group. The origin of this plastid, called the chromatophore, is much more recent than that of the others and its study provides a better understanding of the first steps in the establishment of this type of symbiosis (Box 6). There are therefore two origins to plastids, one which gave almost all of the current plastids and which would have occurred between one and two billion years ago and the other much more recent dating from around sixty million years ago. Certain group A cyanobacteria, to which the usual plastids are related, are able to fix nitrogen, which no current eukaryote seems to be able to do (Table 1), except perhaps _Paulinella chromatophora_, because the genes encoding the nitrogen fixation are present in the chromatophore genome. The eukaryotic host of the first endosymbiosis does not seem to have left any descendants that would not have made the primary endosymbiosis because all [Archaeplastida]({{site.baseurl}}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.md %}), the monophyletic line which includes the organisms resulting from the primary endosymbiosis, possess or at least have possessed a plastid. Analysis of the genomes of [Archaeplastida]({{site.baseurl}}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.md %}) shows that they contain an unusually high number of genes resembling those of Chlamydiae, obligate intracellular parasitic eubacteria of eukaryotic cells. It is therefore possible that Chlamydiae were present in the host before the arrival of the cyanobacterium and that they may have helped establish the symbiosis.

Plastids from primary endosymbiosis are surrounded by a double membrane and as in the case of mitochondria, the origin of the double membrane is not clearly understood. Does it correspond to the double membrane of cyanobacteria or to the membrane of the endocytosis vesicle and the internal membrane of cyanobacteria? The question remains open, although the structure of the cyanelle in [Glaucophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#glaucophyta) suggests that the first solution is the correct one. The selection pressure that favored the first primary endosymbiosis is very probably linked to the photosynthetic capacity of the initial cyanobacterium. Indeed, the fact that no [Archaeplastida]({{site.baseurl}}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.md %}) possesses nitrogenase indicates that the possibility of fixing atmospheric nitrogen is not involved in the establishment of the symbiosis. Initially, cyanobacteria were to serve as prey. But, like all photosynthetic organisms, cyanobacteria secrete sugars into the environment around them. In fact, photosynthesis leads to the formation of a gradient of sugars, free or in complex with other molecules, such as adenosine diphosphoglucose, from the inside to the outside of the cell. The diffusion of sugars to low concentrations to the outside of the cell is an inevitable phenomenon. This is the same phenomenon that allows, for example, the growth of many microorganisms around the roots of plants, a place called the rhizosphere. The persistence of cyanobacteria in the cytoplasm of the predator therefore results in immediate benefit. The sugars thus captured could have been polymerized in the form of glycogen, reinforcing the gradient. The presence of Chlamydiae would have facilitated the establishment of the symbiosis by providing enzymes to polymerize sugars, transporters facilitating the diffusion and then the export of sugars outside the cyanobacteria and the escape of the digestion vesicle, where the cyanobacteria could have coexisted with the Chlamydiae, towards the cytosol. The eukaryotic host would also have contributed to the metabolic integration of the plastids by providing transporters and enzymes allowing the storage of sugars, in particular in the [Viridiplantae]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#viridiplantae), in which starch synthesis has been relocated to the plastid. In the [Glaucophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#glaucophyta) and [Rhodophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#rhodophyta) starch production remained in the cytosol. The current photosynthetic metabolism, in particular the pathways that serve as storage for starch, therefore result from a complex mixture of enzymes and transporters from all three partners. In addition to photosynthesis, plastids perform a large number of metabolic functions including the biosynthesis of amino acids and nitrogenous bases, purines and pyrimidines. Once in place, the first primary symbiosis followed the same evolutionary paths as that of the mitochondria: loss of genes to the nucleus and relocation of plastid proteins via an import system, the origin of which also seems to be bipartite: the heart would come from the cyanobacteria and the annex proteins from the host. About 18% of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ genes are thought to be of cyanobacterial origin. But since the endosymbiosis is more recent than that giving rise to mitochondria, the transfer is less extensive. For example, 127 genes are present in the genome of _Nephroselmis olivacea_. The sizes of the plastid genomes are therefore larger and the structures more complex than those of the mitochondrial genomes. Gene transfers to the nucleus, which can also be easily demonstrated in the laboratory, have been accompanied by changes in size (in part via the presence/absence of group I and II introns) and coding capacity of plastid genomes (Figure 36). While in many [Archaeplastida]({{site.baseurl}}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.md %}), the plastids provide photosynthetic function, this has been lost in non-photosynthetic algae and plants, most of which live as parasites. This is the case, for example, with _Prototheca_, which infect mammals including humans, or _Helicosporidium_, which parasitizes the intestines of insects. In these two genera, the plastid genome sequence shows a slight reduction in coding capacities because most of the genes encoding the subunits of photosynthetic complexes are still present (Figure 36), suggesting a recent adaptation to parasitic life. In the case of _Polytomella_, "green algae" without photosynthesis related to the genus _Chlamydomonas_, the plastid genome appears to have completely disappeared, although the organelle is still present (Figure 37). The genes involved in the expression of plastid genes, such as those encoding ribosome proteins functioning in the organelle, have also disappeared from the nuclear genome! This reduction is reminiscent of that of the mitochondria into a mitosome. In addition to the modification of the genome and the physiology that accompanies it, the expression of genes could evolve, as in the case of mitochondria, towards non-canonical modes of operation: trans-splicing and editing of mRNAs are common. However, these derived modes of expression are less prominent than in mitochondria. For example, there are no real changes in the genetic code. As in cyanobacteria and other prokaryotes, translation initiation can occur on codons other than AUG, but no codons have actually been reassigned.

Like mitochondria in the case of eukaryotes, plastids from major primary endosymbiosis can serve as a phylogenetic marker to trace the evolutionary history of [Archaeplastida]({{site.baseurl}}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.md %}). Previously, photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids and phycobilins) were used as a basis for classification, but there are many exceptions which generally make these pigments poor phylogenetic markers. Analyzes of gene or genome sequences show that [Archaeplastida]({{site.baseurl}}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.md %}) evolved as three distinct lineages. The first to have diverged is that of [Glaucophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#glaucophyta) (Figure 35); it retained the same photosynthetic pigments as the cyanobacteria, just like the [Rhodophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#rhodophyta) (Table 4). However, the ancillary pigments (including phycoerythrin) present in [Rhodophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#rhodophyta) allow the capture of the most energetic visible photons of green and blue light, and therefore penetrate deepest in water, while those of [Viridiplantae]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#viridiplantae) do not trap these photons. They trap the red and blue-violet lights. The [Rhodophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#rhodophyta) will therefore be able to grow deeper, in particular along the coasts, where they mainly occupy the lower level located several meters deep. The last line, that of [Viridiplantae]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#viridiplantae), abandoned chlorophyll c and phycobilins to adopt chlorophyll b (Table 4).

## Secondary, tertiary endosymbioses, etc.
The complexity of the history of plastids quickly became apparent to biologists. In fact, the observation of plastids from various groups of algae by electron microscopy has shown that, in addition to plastids surrounded by two membranes, there are plastids surrounded by three or four membranes (Figure 38). The simplest explanation for this situation is that these plastids are derived either from plastid theft events or kleptoplasty (Box 7), or from secondary endosymbiosis involving eukaryotic algae as the photosynthetic endobiont. In [Cryptophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Hacrobia.html#cryptophyceae) and [Chlorarachniophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Rhizaria.html#filosa), the presence of a degenerate or nucleomorphic nucleus (Box 8) associated with reticulum within the plastid proves that in these two groups the plastid is the result of secondary endosymbiosis. The number of these secondary endosymbiosis events is still debated. Indeed, the initial photosynthetic partner could have been either an alga belonging to either of the [Rhodophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#rhodophyta) or [Viridiplantae]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#viridiplantae), while the hosts have very diverse phylogenetic origins. In the case of endosymbioses involving [Viridiplantae]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#viridiplantae), the scientific community agrees on a number of two independent secondary symbiosis events (Figures 39 and 40). On the other hand, in the case where the symbiosis involved a [Rhodophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#rhodophyta), disagreement reigns with scenarios involving one to several independent initial events, or even a succession of events (Figure 40). There are many reasons for such diverse scenarios to explain the genesis of large groups of algae. The presence of species with or without plastids within the same group could be linked to the loss of plastids rather than to their acquisition. This phenomenon of plastid loss could be widespread and explain the discrepancies observed between the presence/absence of plastids and the phylogenies obtained with nuclear or mitochondrial genes. For example, in the genomes of [Oomycota]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Heterokonta.html#oomycota) and _Blastocytis hominis_, a parasite related to [Oomycota]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Heterokonta.html#oomycota) and [Ochrophyta]({{site.baseurl}}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Ochrophyta.md %}) algae, there are genes of cyanobacterial origin, confirming that these organisms probably derive from algae, although they are not found with any relic of a plastid. Two independent losses are nevertheless necessary to explain the phylogeny (Figure 40), which leads some researchers to support the hypothesis that genes of cyanobacterial origin rather result from horizontal transfers from cyanobacteria which would have served as prey for the ancestors of the [Oomycota]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Heterokonta.html#oomycota) and _Blastocystis_. In [Apicomplexa]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#apicomplexa), the plastid has regressed and no longer performs its photosynthetic function. In these organisms it is called "apicoplast". In contrast, in _Cryptosporidium hominis_, an [Apicomplexa]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#apicomplexa) which rapidly diverged from other parasitic Apicomplexa, the apicoplast has completely disappeared. But genes encoding proteins that function in the apicoplast in other [Apicomplexa]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#apicomplexa) are still present in the nuclear genome, suggesting that the ancestors of this species did indeed possess a plastid. In contrast, in [Ciliophora]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#ciliophora) which are also related to Apicomplexa, genes from cyanobacteria are absent, indicating that they probably never had plastids, thus rejecting the hypothesis of a single secondary endosymbiosis with a [Rhodophyta]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#rhodophyta). Another point supporting the multiple scenarios hypothesis is that it is not because two closely related lineages have plastids that they have a common origin. For example, the different plastid structures of [Apicomplexa]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#apicomplexa) with four membranes and Peridinal Dinoflagellata with three membranes suggest that contrary to what is noted in Figure 40, the plastids could result from independent events in the two groups. The alternative hypothesis is that, as noted in Figure 40, the origin is quite common, but in [Dinoflagellata]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#dinoflagellata) the plastid may have emerged from the endocytic vesicle during evolution, but not in [Apicomplexa]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#apicomplexa). Current data, including recent phylogenies on a large number of genes, rather favor the hypothesis of multiple secondary endosymbiosis events associated with serial kleptoplasty and recurrent losses!

Confusion over the evolution of plastids is even more prevalent if [Dinoflagellata]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#dinoflagellata) are included. In fact, it seems that in [Dinoflagellata]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#dinoflagellata) the replacement of the plastid resulting from secondary endosymbiosis - the ancestral one in this group - by other plastids are very frequent events. This could be facilitated by the fact that Dinoflagellata are able to feed by myzocytosis (Figure 41), allowing plastids to be taken from endocytic vesicles directly in the cytoplasm of prey. In these flagellates, there are at least seven types of plastids and many other "photosynthetic endosymbionts" captured by kleptoplasty. Type 1 plastid with peridinin would therefore have been replaced repeatedly by others containing fuxoxanthin from diatoms (type 7), with 19-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin from Haptophyta algae (types 2 and 4 resulting from two separate events), phycobilins probably coming from Cryptophyta algae (types 3 and 6 also resulting from two events) or with chlorophyll b then probably originating from Viridiplantae Prasinophyta (type 5)! These replacements are often referred to as tertiary endosymbioses, although not all of them are true endosymbiosis events involving algae from secondary endosymbiosis. For example, _Amphidium latum_ or _Gymnodinium acidotum_ capture Cryptophyta which they are able to store without digesting them. Cryptophyta largely retain their morphology but are not properly transmitted to the offspring, so these Dinoflagellata must make new endocytoses to perpetuate the association. _Podolampas bipes_ and _Podolampas reticulata_ contain Dictyophyta algae (a division of [Ochrophyta]({{site.baseurl}}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Ochrophyta.md %})) which is efficiently partitioned and transmitted during divisions to daughter cells. Others, such as _Durinskia baltica_ or _Kryptoperidinium foliaceum_, have captured diatoms. Algae have lost much of their ultrastructure, but retain their nucleus and mitochondria. These algae are faithfully transmitted during the divisions and are therefore already very involved in the association. They therefore reproduce a new process of endosymbiosis and as they originate from a secondary endosymbiosis, it seems that in this case we are dealing with real tertiary endosymbiosis thus giving a new type of plastid (type 7). In fact, this type of plastid is surrounded by **five** membranes! In _Karenia brevis_ and _Karlodinium veneficum_, Cryptophyta also resulting from a secondary endosymbiosis, the symbionts are an integral part of the cell because they are very modified and no longer have a cytoplasm. In this case, it is probably a plastid replacement by kleptoplasty because there appear to be less than four membranes around the plastid (their number is not clearly established, see also Box 7). The record appears to be in _Dinophysis mitra_, in whom more than 100 types of plastids have been detected by sequencing. Plastids from Haptophyta (type 4) seems to predominate because it is detected in 80% of cases, but sequences from Viridiplantae or Ochrophyta algae from various subgroups have been obtained. While kleptoplasty with _Dinophysis mitra_ is no longer in doubt, it is unclear whether plastids are stably present and transmitted to the offspring. In contrast to these plastid gains, some appear to have been lost independently at least twice, in _Crypthecodinium cohnii_ and in _Oxyrrhis marina_. In both cases, genes encoding plastid proteins are present in the nuclear genome, clearly demonstrating a loss in these species which have become phagotrophs again. Note that we will see in the next chapter that these [Dinoflagellata]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#dinoflagellata) often establish endosymbioses with other eukaryotes! These are the famous zooxanthellae that allow the survival of coral reefs.

Plastids from secondary endosymbiosis have undergone the same changes as mitochondria and plastids from primary endosymbiosis: independent and frequent transfers of genes to the nucleus, modifications of the structure of genomes which, like in mitochondria, can take a very strange form in certain [Dinoflagellata]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#dinoflagellata) (Figure 42). There is even an early modification of the genetic code in the Apicomplexan _Neospora caninum_. Indeed, the rpoB gene of this species, encoding one of the subunits of RNA polymerase, contains three UGA stop codons in phase. These are decoded into tryptophan, possibly because the recognition of the UGA stop codon by the ribosome is impaired (the rRNA sequence of the small subunit is compatible with this pattern).

Successive endosymbioses, whether primary, secondary or others, have been accompanied by loss and modification of pigments explaining the diversity observed today. For example, all chlorophylls have an almost identical structure and diverge by a few groups and/or unsaturations which can evolve repeatedly and independently. Table 5 summarizes the origin and diversity of plastids in the different photosynthetic lineages of eukaryotes. So it seems that the chaotic evolution of plastids obscures rather than illuminates the evolution of eukaryotes. Be that as it may, primary endosymbiosis, which directly or indirectly gave rise to the majority of plastids present in eukaryotes, is along with mitochondrial endosymbiosis a major event in the history of eukaryotes. It allowed certain eukaryotes to feed themselves by carrying out oxygenic photosynthesis (Figure 43) and allowing eukaryotes to play the most important role in fixing atmospheric carbon.

In bacteria, besides oxygenic photosynthesis, there are two other types of anoxygenic photosynthesis, that is, photosynthesis which does not produce oxygen. The first also uses multiprotein photosystems containing chlorophyll and is coupled to a Calvin cycle which allows CO<sub>2</sub> to be fixed. This type of photosynthesis is restricted to eubacteria and does not seem to occur in eukaryotes or in archaea. The other type of photosynthesis (Figure 44) uses specific proteins, bacteriorhodopsins, which are related to the light-catching proteins in our retina. These proteins change their conformation by capturing a photon, which allows the translocation of a proton across the membrane where they are embedded. As in the case of classical photosynthesis, the proton gradient thus created can be used to synthesize ATP. Although this type of photosynthesis is not coupled with a Calvin cycle, ATP can be used as a source of energy by the cell. This mechanism is found in various prokaryotes and especially in archaea of the Halobacteria group. Rhodopsins that can act as a proton pump have been described in various eukaryotes, including fungi. These proteins could be involved in pH homeostasis or help generate a proton gradient for the facilitated transport of solutes. However, in some plastid-lacking [Dinoflagellata]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.html#dinoflagellata), including _Oxyrrhis marina_, horizontal transfer of a bacteriorhodopsin gene has occurred from a eubacterium related to Proteobacteria. Dinoflagellata have not yet been shown to use these proteins to make ATP. But the gene, which is nuclear in _Oxyrrhis marina_, is highly expressed and the protein is located in an intracellular compartment, still unidentified, but which is not a plastid because the precursor does not have a signal peptide to go to a plastid. It could be the vacuole. The protein could then allow the synthesis of ATP via vacuolar ATPase, or else avoid the consumption of ATP to acidify the vacuole by using light, not ATP, as the energy source. Regardless, it appears that expression of the gene encoding bacteriorhodopsin is induced by light in _Oxyrrhis marina_ and its survival is greater in the presence than in the absence of light when deprived of prey.

Endosymbiosis of the mitochondria and plastids have been permitted because eukaryotes have the ability to phagocytize whole cells. It is therefore not surprising that endosymbioses have played and continue to play essential roles in the evolution of eukaryotes. The next section will examine how these symbioses, whether intracellular or otherwise, come together and show their diversity in eukaryotes.
