title: Some theories to explain the origin of the eukaryotic cell
category: Origin of the eukaryotic cell

There are several theories trying to explain the origin of the eukaryotic cell and its relationship to prokaryotic cells. None are satisfactory to date because each explains part of the story but does not account for all of the attributes of the eukaryotic cell. These theories can be classified into several groups ({%- include fignum.html fn="018.eukarogenesis" -%}): those which assume that (1) the three groups of living beings have an independent origin, (2) prokaryotes and eukaryotes derive from a common ancestor, the **Last Universal Common Ancestor** or **LUCA**, mainly by simplification for prokaryotes complexification for eukaryotes, LUCA possibly having been a "proto-eukaryote", (3) eukaryotes derive from prokaryotes by fusion and/or endosymbiosis mechanisms.
