title: An overview of the diversity of eukaryotes

Although the inventory of eukaryotes is not yet complete, the data already available and confirmed by molecular phylogenies provide an overview of their evolution. Nevertheless, this view will probably change in its details as new groups are described. Indeed, if the discoveries of new species of animals and plants are still frequent, those of larger groups (genera, families, orders or classes) are now exceptional in these two groups. On the contrary, descriptions of such taxonomic ranks, or even new phyla, in the case of protists are not at all uncommon. For example, in 2011 the [Rozellida]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Holomycota.html#rozellida) were described, also known as Cryptomycota. These fungal-related organisms were previously known only by the genus Rozella and classified among the [Eumycota]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Eumycota.md %}). Metagenomic analyzes have shown that these organisms are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems and very genetically diverse. The Rozellida now form a new phylum.

Likewise, the number of species within each group is often open to discussion. For example, [Ciliophora]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Heterokonta.html#ciliophora) are a unicellular group that has characteristics unique to eukaryotes, including the presence of a somatic nucleus and a germline nucleus. Molecular phylogenies have confirmed the monophyly of the group. However, the figures found in the scientific literature for the number of species fluctuate between 4,000 and 40,000! A first estimate combined a bibliographic approach of the species described with direct sampling. This first method estimates the total number of morphospecies at 3,750. 800 are found in marine sediments and 1,370 in freshwater sediments. Direct observations of sediment samples estimate the number of marine species at 600 and of freshwater species at 730. The two estimates therefore converge to establish a limited number of [Ciliophora]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Heterokonta.html#ciliophora) morphospecies. Analysis of the distribution of these species shows that they are most often cosmopolitan. In summary, the [Ciliophora]({{site.baseurl}}/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Heterokonta.html#ciliophora) would show a relatively low morphological diversity with a cosmopolitan distribution and most of the species would already be described. In contrast, a statistical analysis suggests that only half of the morphospecies have been described because not all habitats have been analyzed in detail. The actual number of species would then be close to 40,000 because genetic diversity data suggests that each morpho-species corresponds to about ten species. In this second estimate, 90% of the species remain to be described. This type of controversy is not unique. Indeed, even more divergent figures are advanced for Eumycota. About 80,000 species are currently described. It is generally estimated that more than one million species remain to be described. This figure comes from estimates based on the number of biotopes that remain to be analyzed and the fact that the Eumycota seem less cosmopolitan than often assumed. Indeed, many species are known having a restricted habitat because they live for example in exclusive association with plants or insects. Often their host spectrum is restricted to a genus or even a species or a variety. In areas where flora and mycoflora are well known, such as Western Europe, there are six times more species of fungi than plants. This allows to estimate at 1.5 million the number of species of fungus because there are approximately 250,000 species of plants in the world. This figure does not take into account insect pests / mutualists. Some mycologists argue that there may be at least as many, if not more, species of fungi as there are insects. As there are currently several million species of insects, they put the number of Eumycota mushroom species at 10,000,000! If this estimate is correct, at the current rate, it will take 10,000 years to describe all these fungi ...
