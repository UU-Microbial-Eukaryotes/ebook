## Introduction
The **Alveolata** have been clearly defined thanks to molecular phylogenies. The phylogenies indicate that Alveolata are related to **[Heterokonta]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Heterokonta.md %})** and **[Rhizaria]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Rhizaria.md %})** in a lineage tentatively called SAR or Harosa (Figure 215). Alveolata have the common characteristics of having vesicles positioned just under their plasma membrane, forming a kind of alveoli (Figure 294). Their mitochondria have tubular ridges. The alveoli have allowed the evolution of attributes specific to each evolutionary lineage. Note that the Glaucophyta also have alveoli which probably appeared by evolutionary convergence.

Molecular phylogenies distinguish 3 main groups of Alveolata: [Ciliophora](#ciliophora), [Apicomplexa](#apicomplexa) and [Dinoflagellata](#dinoflagellata), each having followed a very particular evolutionary process (Figure 295). In addition to these three groups, there are a few minority lines. Note that analyzes of marine picoplankton show that two other as yet unstudied groups of Alveolata exist. These two groups appear to be the major components of picoplankton. Their biology is still completely unknown to us.

Plastids have clearly been present during evolution of the [Apicomplexa](#apicomplexa) and [Dinoflagellata](#dinoflagellata), but if they were present also in [Ciliophora](#ciliophora) is currently under discussion. Plastids are functional in most [Dinoflagellata](#dinoflagellata) and have undergone a complex evolution with multiple replacements. They regressed in [Apicomplexa](#apicomplexa), to the point of disappearing completely in some species. Independent regressions were also identified in other Alveolata, which leaves the reason for their absence in [Ciliophora](#ciliophora) unanswered. According to some biologists, these organisms have always been devoid of the plastid and it is the result of a secondary endosymbiosis or kleptoplasty that occurred in the ancestor of the [Apicomplexa](#apicomplexa)/[Dinoflagellata](#dinoflagellata) (Myzozoa; see Figure 40). The predatory members of this lineage are currently capable of myzocytosis, which supports this hypothesis. In this context, the plastid, although also derived from a [Rhodophyta](/Microbial-eukaryotes/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Archaeplastida.html#rhodophyta), would have a different origin from that of Heterokonta / Haptophyta / Cryptophyta. Another group of biologists supports a common origin to the plastids of Alveolata and those of Heterokonta / Haptophyta / Cryptophyta. This hypothesis brings more complex scenarios of evolution into play. For instance, the plastid would have to have been lost among the [Ciliophora](#ciliophora). The plastid would have have been kept in the lineage leading to the [Apicomplexa](#apicomplexa), in which it has four membranes, and in the [Dinoflagellata](#dinoflagellata), it would have been lost and replaced several times.

## Ciliophora
The first diverging Alveolata group is the Ciliophora phylum, commonly known as the ciliates. Their origin is ancient because fossil ciliophora thecae date back to 450 Ma ago. The phylum includes about 7,000 species of single-celled phagotrophs which occupy many ecological niches. There are planktonic and benthic forms, in the sea or in freshwater; others live in moist soils, mosses, etc. A few species live with various symbionts: algae and bacteria. The algae provide carbonaceous matter and the bacteria toxin "killers" which kill individuals who do not harbor them. Some species of Ciliophora are parasites, others are commensal and live in the intestines of various herbivorous mammals. One species, _Balantidium coli_, occasionally parasitizes humans (Figure 296). A few species, such as _Ichthyophthirius multifiliis_, are fish parasites and can wreak significant havoc in fish farms or aquariums. In nature, Ciliophora are often the second link in the food chain in ecosystems. They feed on bacteria, algae or other protozoa that they ingest through their cell mouth or **cytostome**. Experiments have clearly shown that their presence keeps the amount of bacteria in many biotopes low, as they consume up to 90% of bacteria and algae. In the laboratory, it is possible to cultivate the species of the genus _Tetrahymena_ on simple media with nutrients in solution, while members of _Paramecium_ demand living bacteria and _Stentor_ feed on other Ciliophora. Note that the macronuclear genome sequences of _Paramecium tetraurelia_ and _Tetrahymena thermophila_ did not identify genes typically functioning in plastids, suggesting that if the ancestor to these organisms did have a plastid, it did not leave genomic traces.

Most Ciliophora are large in size; _Stentor_ measures up to 2 mm. Ciliophora are very complex with defined morphologies that vary depending on the species. Each cell resembles a "little animal" with a musculoskeletal system, environmental sensing systems and a digestive system comprising a mouth, an intracellular stomach and an apparatus for excreting waste or cytoprect (Figures 296 and 297). They are polarized with the presence of a front and a rear. However, the two main characteristics of Ciliophora are the presence of a complex and important ciliature, which gave them their name, and especially the presence of two different types of nuclei, called micronuclei and macronuclei. The ciliature allows rapid movements and facilitates the capture of prey. Micronuclei are diploid and serve only for the transmission of information during reproduction. They are transcriptionally inactive and can be considered "germline" nuclei. Micronuclei have chromosomes and resemble nuclei of eukaryotes in general. They are divided by classical mitoses. Macronuclei, on the other hand, carry fragmented chromosomes and are transcriptionally active. If they divide, it is through a process of partitioning DNA molecules that is not mitosis. The micronuclei therefore form a lineage of germ nuclei specifically devoted to reproduction, while the macronuclei mimic a somatic line and ensure the expression of genetic material. Macronuclei disappear either during cell division or during sexual reproduction. They are resynthesized from micronuclei by modifications of genetic material, in ways that call for epigenetic information (Box 21). Note that depending on the species, there are one or more micronuclei and one or more macronuclei per cell. This particular biology of the nuclei has been accompanied by modifications of the nuclear genetic code in greater proportions than in other organisms. For example, UAA and UAG code for glutamine instead of stop in _Tetrahymena_, _Paramecium_ and _Stylonychia_. UAA codes for glutamic acid in _Vorticella_. The most surprising is found in _Euplotes_ where UGA codes for cysteine or for selenocysteine. Which amino acid is inserted depends on signals present in the messenger RNA, the two amino acids can be inserted via separate UGA codons in the same mRNA! The Ciliophora divide by transverse fission (Figure 297). Their polarization therefore involves complex morphogenetic mechanisms, as the front part must regenerate a rear and vice versa. Some of the morphogenetic processes are inherited in a non-Mendelian way (Box 21). Some species are able to differentiate into a cyst when conditions are unfavorable and to "sleep" for several months. The sexual cycle has been described in many species and follows modalities that are specific to Ciliophora (Figure 297). Often there are systems of mating types that determine compatibilities between cells. These are also sometimes inherited epigenetically (Box 21). Sexual reproduction is necessary for the survival of many Ciliophora clones. Indeed, the life of a clone is divided into three phases which can last up to several hundred divisions. Right after conjugation, there is a first period of immaturity during which the cells divide vigorously but cannot conjugate. After that, a phase of maturity is established where the cells divide vigorously and can conjugate. Finally, there is a phase of senescence where growth slows down and the cells end up dying unless they conjugate or self-fertilize. The first phase is controlled by the production of a protein called "immaturin". The transition from immaturity to maturity is controlled by processes of gene repression / activation, the details of which are still unknown. The senescence phase appears to be controlled by changes in the macronucleus because the injection of macronuclei from young cells into older cells significantly prolongs the life of the latter.

Long based on morphology, ciliary structure and other ultrastructural features, the classification of Ciliophora has been improved by DNA sequence data. Molecular phylogenies currently define two sub-branches (Figure 298).

<br>
### Postciliodesmatophora
The Postciliodesmatophora subphylum contains two classes, [Karyorelictea](#karyorelictea) and [Heterotrichea](#heterotrichea), whose members exhibit characteristics that appear to be more "primitive" than those of other Ciliophora. Members of the two classes exhibit common structures in the basal body environment, in particular the presence of a ribbon of specific microtubules attached to the basal body called "postciliodesmatum", confirming the results of molecular phylogenies.

<br>
#### Karyorelictea
There are about 130 species of Karyorelictea that live mainly in coastal sediments; only the genus _Loxodes_ contains freshwater species (Figure 299). The most notable feature of members of this class is the non-dividing macronucleus which has reduced ploidy; in some cases it even seems to remain diploid. Macronuclei are segregated at random during divisions and eventually degenerate. They must therefore be constantly produced from micronuclei. These groups of Ciliophora cannot be cultivated in the laboratory. Some can grow very large, sometimes close to half a centimeter. They have colonized many marine and freshwater environments.

<br>
#### Heterotrichea
There are several hundred species of Heterotrichea (Figure 299). Like [Karyorelictea](#karyorelictea), species of Heterotrichea are usually large, and characterized by division of the macronucleus with the help of microtubules located outside the nucleus. Their name derives from the fact that they have long cilia involved in the formation of a "paraoral" membrane around the cytostome, and smaller cilia on the rest of the cell body. Their body is very deformable; _Stentor_ can, for example, retract into a spherical shape. Some have beautiful red or blue colors.

<br>
### Intramacronucleata
The second subphylum, that of Intramacronucleata, includes the vast majority of Ciliophora. All members are characterized by the presence of microtubules inside the macronucleus during its division. The subphylum is made up of three major classes and seven minor lineages. These lines are differentiated mainly on the structure of the cilia and are generally confirmed by the sequence data. Nevertheless, convergences in the arrangement of the cilia or the structure of the basal bodies have been identified, making molecular phylogenies important for obtaining a better phylogenetic classification. A first line, containing only one genus, _Protocruzia_, and a few species, seems to diverge first. However, molecular phylogenies provide conflicting data as to its exact position in the Ciliophora tree and this genus could possibly belong to the [Postciliodesmatophora](#postciliodesmatophora) subphylum. These are marine and benthic organisms (Figure 300) whose macronuclear behavior is different from that of other Intramacronucleata, confirming that it could be an early-diverging group, as shown in Figure 298. Indeed, they have a single micronucleus surrounded by ten or so macronuclei. These divide by a process that resembles true mitosis with condensation of the chromosomes and an anaphase-like separation.

<br>
#### Listostomatae
The major class of [Intramacronucleata](#intramacronucleata) that appears to diverge first is Listostomatae (Figure 298). It contains several hundred species, some of which live free and others in commensal, parasitic or mutualistic symbionts of the vertebrate intestines. The human parasite _Balantidium coli_ (Figure 296) belongs to this class. Some species appear to have a particular diet involving kleptoplasty (see Box 7). Others are very voracious and consume flagellates, ciliates, and even small animals. The sizes vary from about 30 microns to almost 2 mm and the shapes of these Ciliophora are very diverse (Figure 301).

<br>
#### Armophorea
The class of Armophorea is related to that of [Listostomatae](#listostomatae) (Figure 298). It brings together a few hundred species of anaerobic Ciliophora, whose mitochondria have evolved into hydrogenosomes. They thrive in marine or freshwater sediments, the water column of anoxic lakes or in symbionts in the intestines of various animals including ruminants. Some of them harbor methanogenic bacteria. They feed on bacteria and excrete acetate and propionate, which in symbiotic species can be consumed by the host. Most species have the ability to differentiate cysts for their survival or transmission. They have an average size for Ciliophora, i.e. around 100 μm (Figure 301). The shapes adopted vary widely: ovoid, elongated, helmet-shaped, etc.

<br>
#### Spirotrichea
The second important class which then diverges is that of Spirotrichea (Figure 298). With a few thousand species, this class is very diverse with few characteristics that bring the different members together (Figure 302). In particular, the morphology is very variable and the sizes vary from 5 μm to 1 mm, even if most of the members are between 100 and 200 μm. Part of the species are protected in a lorica. The macronuclear genome is often extremely fragmented, a feature they share with [Phyllopharyngea](#colpodea-nassophorea-phyllopharyngea-prostomatea-and-plagiopylea) and [Armophorea](#armophorea), but which appears to have been acquired through convergent evolution in all three classes. The area around the cytostome usually shows structures resembling the paraoral membrane of [Heterotrichea](#heterotrichea), a feature also acquired by convergent evolution. The ciliature is often sparse and the cilia can be grouped together in cirrhia. Some of the better known ciliates such as _Euplotes_ and _Stylonychia_ belong to this class (Figure 302).

<br>
#### Colpodea, Nassophorea, Phyllopharyngea, Prostomatea and Plagiopylea
The next five classes, Colpodea, Nassophorea, Phyllopharyngea, Prostomatea and Plagiopylea, each contain from a few dozen to a few hundred species (Figure 303). The characters shared within each of the classes, which were formed most often by molecular phylogenies, are few in number and essentially ultrastructural. Colpodea are known for their ability to form cysts, allowing them to invade environments that frequently dry out. _Sorogena stoianovitchae_, a species that evolved an aggregative multicellularity (Figure 304) belongs to this class. Plagiopylea are microaerophilic or anaerobic and like Armophorea have hydrogenosomes. They inhabit the same biotopes as the Armophorea. Certain Phyllopharyngea, the members of the Suctoria subclass, have very particular morphologies, being completely devoid of cilia during the trophic phase (Figures 305); the other members of the class have more canonical morphologies and live free or in companionship of invertebrate animals. These fascinating Ciliophora live attached to many aquatic animals, and differentiate a ciliated form to move (Figure 305).

<br>
#### Oligohymenophorea
The last class of Ciliophora, Oligohymenophorea, is the most important in number of species, numbering in the thousands. The members present a diversity of forms (Figure 306) and functions with free species, marine or freshwater, species attached to the substrate in isolation such as _Vorticella_ or grouped in single colonies such as _Zoothamnium_, parasites of mussels, such as _Ophryoglena hemophaga_, or fish, such as _Ichthyophthirius multifiliis_, etc. Sizes vary from 10 μm to over three millimeters! Many species change shape if nutrients are deficient, or for parasitic species when it is time to disperse. The name of Oligohymenophorea comes from the low number of cilia present around the cytostome (cell mouth), a character widely shared within the class. Many known species of ciliates belong to this group, such as _Vorticella_ or the laboratory models _Paramecium tetraurelia_ and _Tetrahymena thermophila_.

The rest of the known Alveolata appear to form a monophyletic group. However, the phylogenetic positions of Colponemidia and Acavomonidia as shown in Figure 295 are not completely assured. These two branches have only a few species each. Colponemidia are small phagotrophic flagellates that present a ventral groove through which they feed (figure 307). These organisms therefore retain the same primitive characteristics as those of Sulcozoa and Excavata (see pages 135 & 253), confirming their basal position in the Alveolata tree. Acavomonidia are also phagotrophic flagellates, but lack the ventral groove (Figure 307).
