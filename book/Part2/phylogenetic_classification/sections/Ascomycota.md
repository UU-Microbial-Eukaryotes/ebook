### Introduction
The Ascomycota, ascomycetes in the vernacular language, form the group of Dikarya which contains the greatest number of species, since approximately 65% of the species of all described fungi belong to this lineage. The shared character of the group, recognized as early as the 19th century, is the fact that their meiospores are produced inside a sac called ascus, hence their name ascospores (figure 140). Phylogenetic analyzes confirm that the group is monophyletic and show that these fungi have diversified into three independent lineages: **Taphrinomycotina**, **Saccharomycotina**, and **Pezizomycotina** (Figure 141). That of Taphrinomycotina diverged first from the other two. The fungi of Taphrinomycotina and Saccharomycotina can be considered simple in form and function. On the other hand, the class of Pezizomycotina contains species with complex characters.

<br>
### Taphrinomycotina
The Taphrinomycotina, formerly called Archiascomycetes, form a group of "primitive" Ascomycota comprising a few dozen species, but with very varied biology. Currently, five classes are distinguished. Taphrinomycetes are parasites of plants. In nature, they are mainly found in the leaves as dikaryotic mycelia, a condition also exhibited by Basidiomycota, but not by other Ascomycota where the dikaryotic state is confined to a fruiting body. This mycelium cannot be cultivated in an axenic medium. Monokaryotic strains are yeast-like and can be cultured. The type species of the class is _Taphrina deformans_, a pest of peach and almond (Figure 142). Its genome has been sequenced. It encompasses 13.5 Mb and contains around 6,000 genes, which makes it more like yeast genomes than those of mycelial species which have genomes twice as large or even larger. The life cycle (Figure 143) is essentially sexual.

There are only three species of Neolectomycetes all belonging to the genus Neolecta. These fungi form multicellular fruiting bodies (Figure 144). These appeared by convergent evolution. Indeed, although the ontogeny of these fruiting bodies is unknown, the manufacture of the asci that they bear occurs in a different way from that of Pezizomycotina. In particular, there is no hook and the two nuclei that will merge are attached by a structure visible under electron microscopy. Analysis of the pore between the cells of the mycelium, the only one performed to date for a Taphrinomycotina, shows a simple structure different from that found in Pezizomycotina. Unfortunately, these fungi cannot be cultivated in a Petri dish, due to the fact that _Neolecta_ are probably mycorrhizal fungi.

Species in the Archaeorhizomycetes class have only recently been discovered and have long been known only from environmental DNA sequences. There are hundreds of species that seem to live associated with the roots of plants. Not forming mycorrhizae, these fungi are thought to be saprotrophs feeding on root exudates. The high frequency with which they are detected indicates that these fungi are ubiquitous in soils, especially tundra, and probably form a considerable biomass. It is only very recently that their cultivation has allowed them to be better studied. The slowness of their growth (a few mm per month) does not allow us to conclude on their trophic mode. They are not known to have a sexual cycle, or even asexual. Bulges of hyphae are however present and could serve as chlamydospores.

The class of Schizosaccharomycetes contains only four species of saprotrophic yeast dividing by fission. The best known member is the yeast _Schizosaccharomyces pombe_, commonly known as the fission yeast, which is used in Africa to make beer. Nowadays it is used in many research laboratories which study various aspects of cell biology. In fact, we can easily select mutants in this yeast and carry out genetic analysis. It has served in particular as a model for the study of the cell cycle. It reproduces by binary fission. The species has a haplobiontic life cycle with two sexual types (Figure 145). Its genome sequence is available. It is distributed over three chromosomes, and is the genome of a non-parasitic eukaryotic cell that contains the smallest number of genes; the current estimate is 4824.

The last class of the Taphrinomycotina, the Pneumocystidiomycetes, contains species that have long been classified as parasitic protozoa. Indeed, the _Pneumocystis_ are commensals or obligate parasites of the lungs of mammals. Usually the infection is asymptomatic, but becomes serious if the immune system is weak. Molecular data shows that there are several species that each specifically infect a host. There could even be as many species of _Pneumocystis_ as there are species of mammals! _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ specifically infects humans (Figure 146). It is probably the most common opportunist in AIDS patients. This fungus is present all around the world and enters the body via the respiratory tract. However, the infectious form that spreads the disease is still unknown. Once in the lungs, it mainly grows inside the alveoli and causes pneumonia if the immune system is weak. Unfortunately, we do not know how to cultivate these fungi in vitro, which makes their study difficult. The genome, made up of about fifteen chromosomes, is small (8 Mb) and has a high level of T and A nucleotides (65%). Unusually for Ascomycota but classic for Basidiomycota, the genes are rich in introns.

### Saccharomycotina
The Saccharomycotina, formerly the Hemiascomycetes, represent only 1% of the species of fungi. Despite this, this group contains many species important to human industry, including the bread / wine / beer yeast, _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. As a result, Saccharomycotina serve as study models in many laboratories and as a factory for the production of proteins and metabolites in industry. In particular, _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ has been used extensively to analyze the cellular physiology of the micropores or plasmodesmata of the eukaryotic cell (Box 16). Currently, Saccharomycotina are used to understand the evolution of genomes, resulting in the availability of the greatest number of complete genome sequences for a defined group of eukaryotes (see Figure 112). There are at least 600 species, but their diversity must be greatly underestimated, because a recent inventory of the diversity of yeasts present in the intestines of tropical beetles has made it possible to double the number of Saccharomycotina species!

Genomic analyzes show that these organisms derive from more complex fungi by reductive evolution. They do not form multicellular fruiting structures and most are yeasts which divide by budding. However, some species produce pseudohyphae under certain conditions, even true hyphae such as _Geotrichum candidum_, _Ashbya gossypii_ or _Yarrowia lipolytica_. These hyphae are nevertheless simpler than those of other fungi with in particular the absence of a central pore and the presence of micropores (Figure 147). Most species are saprotrophs that consume simple sugars or lipids, but they can also be found as commensals of vertebrates or insects. _Ashbya gossypii_ is a pest of cotton. In the Saccharomycotina, we find _Candida_, of which about ten species are opportunistic pathogens in humans. _Candida_ causes skin or systemic infections that can be transmitted by different routes including the sexual route. The most important species today is _Candida albicans_, which is the most common pathogenic fungus in humans (Box 16).

### Pezizomycotina
The Pezizomycotina, formerly Euascomycetes, represent the vast majority of Ascomycota with several tens of thousands of species described, or 60% of all known fungi. They have invaded most environments: water, soil, plants and animal intestinesâ€¦ They have evolved in recurrent ways towards all styles of life. Half of the species described live in association with algae to form lichens. However, this proportion does not reflect the true proportion because most of the lichen species are already described while those of the other trophic groups are only partially known. Saprotrophs are very numerous and well known to spoil our food. A few are ectomycorrhizals, many more are parasites / symbionts of plants or animals. Most species exhibit characteristics typical of "complex" fungi. They have an integrated filamentous thallus with efficient anastomoses and so-called Woronin-seeded septal pores that connect the cells together (Figure 148). Some species may switch to a mode of growing as a yeast. Many Pezizomycotina build multicellular fruiting bodies often of sizes less than 1 mm but sometimes of large sizes, like the elfin saddles (Figure 149). These fructifications served as a basis for classification until the end of the 20th century (Box 17). Molecular phylogenies have since shown that fruiting bodies have evolved convergently multiple times. Besides ascospores, Pezizomycotina are capable of producing numerous mitospores which can ensure asexual dissemination. There are several mechanisms that make it possible to produce these mitospores, such as the fragmentation of the mycelium or the differentiation of certain cells. The most common are the conidia or conidiospores which differentiate at the tip of a particular hyphae, the conidiophore (Box 17). Conidiophores can be isolated or grouped into synemata (sing. Synema). They are either directly exposed to the outside or protected in structures called acervuli and pycnidia (Box 17). Most species therefore have a sexual cycle and an asexual cycle. Figure 150 shows the generic life cycle, but there are many variations across species. Molecular phylogenies divide the Pezizomycotina into thirteen classes, six of which are important both for the number of species they possess and for their ecological roles.

The class of Pezizomycotina that seems to be the earliest diverging is the Orbiliomycetes. This placement is supported by some molecular phylogenies, but not all. The ultrastructure of the asci and septal pores appears to be simpler than in other Pezizomycotina, supporting the hypothesis of early divergence from the rest of the clade. There are a few hundred species. They are saprotrophs living mainly in soils. Their sexual cycle is not well known because teleomorphs are rarely observed and produce very small apothecia (fruiting bodies). Most species trap nematodes to supplement their diet. This is the case with _Arthrobotrys oligospora_ which captures nematodes and other small animals via special snare-shaped hyphae (Figure 151). The prey is then digested by extracellular enzymes.

The other candidate for being the most divergent class is that of the Pezizomycetes. This lineage includes fungi which have apothecia-type fruiting bodies, very often of large size. The most famous members have a culinary interest, such as truffles, morels and the orange-peel fungus (Figure 152). More than 1,200 species of Pezizomycetes are currently described. In this group,  mainly saprophytes are found, but also some species forming ectomycorrhizae such as the truffle with oak and some other trees. Other species live associated with plants without us always clearly knowing the relationships they maintain. For example, morels are saprotrophic but seem to be able in certain cases to engage in mycorrhizae. Others are clearly pests of plants, like _Neottiella_. Despite the gastronomic interest, the fruiting of these mushrooms is so far poorly controlled. For example, the truffle requires the presence of trees to fruit and the required signal is unknown. It is also in this group that the _Ascobolus_ are found, which are used as models in some laboratories or in biology classes. _Ascobolus_ have microscopic fruiting bodies and are common on herbivore droppings.

The other Pezizomycotina are divided into two major lineages: the "Sordariomyceta" and the "Dothideomyceta" (these terms are not formal taxonomical groups). The Sordariomyceta group together five classes, two of which are interesting for their low number of species but important roles in ecosystems. Indeed, the class of Geoglossomycetes contains only a few species. These fungi are saprotrophic and form large apothecia in the shape of rods or spatulas (Figure 153). They are often found associated with mosses. The few currently described species of the Xylonomycetes class live as endophytes of rubber trees. Only the anamorphs, which produce conidia protected in pycnidia, are currently known of these fungi. The line of Laboulbeniomycetes contains species whose biology is very particular compared to that of other Pezizomycotina. Indeed, they are epibionts of insects and have a defined development giving rise to a thallus with a constant number of cells. This is made up of a few tens of cells at most (often less) and measures a few tens of micrometers. The thallus is attached to the cuticle of an insect, often in a specific location, and it is not known if it causes discomfort for the insect (Figure 154). This thallus differentiates a small perithecium giving rise to ascospores which are sticky and ensure the spread of the fungus during contact between insects. Most species are homothallic, but there are a few heterothallics. There are several hundred species.

Importantly, the class of Leotiomycetes contains several thousand species, including saprotrophs, mycorrhiza-forming species, necrotrophs and obligate parasites of plants. The fruiting bodies are often apothecia-like and very colorful (Figure 155), but Erysiphales are different by having characteristic cleistothecia (Figure 146, _Erysiphe flexuosa_ [Translator's note: _This must point towards the wrong figure..._]). Important pathogens include _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_, _Botrytis cinerea_ and _Monilia_ (Figure 156). These fungi are necrotrophic pathogens with a broad host spectrum; e.g. up to 200 different species are attacked by _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. _Botrytis cinerea_ causes "gray rot". However, it is also used during the vinification of sweet wines such as Sauternes. Indeed, in certain climatic conditions, it causes a "noble rot" which allows the wine to acquire its richness in sugar and its characteristic taste. _Monilia_ attack fruits such as apples, pears or quinces and cause brown rot, a dreaded disease by fruit growers.

The fifth and final class of Sordariomyceta is that of Sordariomycetes. This line contains more than 10,000 species that live either as saprotrophs or as parasites or mutualists of plants, animals or other fungi. Their fruiting bodies are perithecia that develop only after fertilization of the female gamete by a male gamete (Figure 146, _Podospora anserina_). These may not have an ostiole, but in this case a differentiated hymenium is still present, or be grouped in a large stroma as in _Xylaria_ (Figure 157). It is in this group that we find the laboratory model fungi that are widely used for genetic and molecular analyzes: _Sordaria_, _Neurospora_ and _Podospora_. These saprotrophs have rapid growth, simple nutritional demands and a short and perfectly controlled sexual reproduction cycle. They therefore serve as models for molecular genetic studies to elucidate multiple biological phenomena. Many species in this group are plant pathogens that pose big problems in agriculture. _Magnaporthe oryzae_ is the main pathogen of rice, the most widely consumed cereal in the world. _Fusarium graminearum_ (= _Gibberella zea_) is an important wheat pest that can pollute with mycotoxins. For the former, the infection is spread either by conidia or via the mycelium which then enters the plant through the root. For the latter, the infection is spread by ascospores. _Claviceps purpurea_ which infects rye, is another famous species because of the alkaloids it produces, which if consumed, by eating bread made from contaminated flour, leads to ergotism associated with gangrene, loss of limbs and death. The alkaloids produced by this fungus cause vasoconstrictions. Numerous "epidemics" of ergotism have occurred in the past without, at the time, a cause being identified. Now these alkaloids are used in medicine but also as drugs, the famous LSD is a derivative of the alkaloids of this fungus! _Tolypocladium inflatum_, an endophytic species close to _Claviceps_, produces cyclosporin A which allowed the development of organ transplants because it is an immunosuppressant which has no side effects. _Ophiostoma ulmi_ and _novo-ulmi_ have destroyed elms in Europe and now in North America. _Cryphonectria parasitica_ destroys chestnut trees in North America. The list of these important pathogens for human societies is still long! The pathogenic Sordariomycetes of animals are grouped mainly in the Cordycipitaceae family. Little is known about their impact on insect populations, but these fungi are collected very frequently, suggesting a major role in population control (Figure 158). Finally, there are some species which parasitize other fungi, such as _Trichoderma_ (Figure 159). _Trichoderma reseei_, the only species of the genus which is saprotrophic, is widely used in industry as a source of various lytic enzymes (glucanases, cellulases, hemicellulase, etc.) which it secretes in the medium in large quantities.

The second large lineage of Pezizomycotina is that of Dothideomyceta which includes six classes. Lecanoromycetes, Arthoniomycetes, Lichinomycetes and Coniocybomycetes group together lichens. All of them make apothecia, though these structures differ from class to class. Of these four classes, the most important is that of Lecanoromycetes since it includes 90% of known lichen species (Figure 160). A few species in this class are saprotrophs which appear to have lost the ability to live as a lichen. One species, _Stictis_ / _Conotrema_, can also adopt both lifestyles. The class of Dothideomycetes contains more than 10,000 species presenting all the styles of life known to Eumycota: saprotrophs, lichens, parasites and mutualists of plants, animals etc. It is probably the most diverse class of Pezizomycotina. In this group, the fruiting bodies are pseudothecia (Figure 161) containing asci with a particular spore release mechanism that distinguishes them from other Pezizomycotina producing pseudothecia. The so-called bitunicated asci have in fact two walls which break sequentially. Important species include _Alternaria_ which produce allergenic spores; _Cochliobolus, Leptosphaeria, Pyrenophora_ and _Mycosphaerella_ which infect many cultivated plants: rapeseed, wheat, corn, etc. Finally, among the saprotrophs, let us mention _Baudoinia compniacensis_ which feeds on alcohol vapor and which can be found in whiskey distilleries or on Cognac rooftops!

The last class of Dothideomyceta and more generally of Pezizomycotina, that of Eurotiomycetes, which is probably the most important of all of them for human societies. In fact, this class includes important human pathogens, but also fungi used in industry and especially the fungus that led to the discovery of antibiotics, _Penicillium notatum_. There are several thousand species in this class. In nature, Eurotiomycetes are saprotrophs, which can sometimes attack plants, or lichens. The phylogeny strongly suggests that saprotrophic forms derive from lichens. These fungi have simpler fruiting bodies than those of other Pezizomycotina. They are cleistothecia or gymnothecia. The best known members are _Aspergillus_ and _Penicillium_. The difference between the two genera is based on the shape of the conidiophores, but this character imperfectly reflects their phylogeny. Teleomorphs are often unknown because most species have no known sexuality. Perhaps to compensate, they produce incredible quantities of very volatile conidia. In fact, the majority of contaminations observed on food or materials are caused by _Penicillium_ or _Aspergillus_ (Figure 162). _Aspergillus_ are used as study models in many laboratories but they are also widely used in the pharmaceutical and food industry. _Aspergillus oryzae_ is used for making sake. It starts the degradation of rice starch and the sugars produced serve as the basis for fermentation by yeasts or bacteria. _Aspergillus niger_ is used for the production of citric acid of which 500,000 tonnes are produced each year. Several species of _Aspergillus_ produce mycotoxins (ochratoxins, sterimagocystins ...) which are very toxic. As these fungi have the ability to grow in fairly dry environments, they can invade foodstuffs if they are not properly stored. The accumulation of mycotoxins can then become dangerous and lead to the loss of stored products. _Penicillium_ are most famous for the production of antibiotics. In fact, the first antibiotic discovered and exploited was penicillin, first produced by _Penicilium notatum_, now by _Penicillium chrysogenum_ (Figure 163). Nowadays, many antibiotics are chemically synthesized but some continue to be purified from fungi such as beta-lactams including penicillin G and cephalosporin C. It is in this genus that the famous _Penicillium camemberti_ and _Penicillium roqueforti_ are found, whose evocative names indeed indicate that they are involved in the manufacture of cheese (Figure 108).

Many Eurotiomycetes are important for public health (Table 9). The most important in France is _Aspergillus fumigatus_ which causes often fatal aspergillosis. It infects immunocompromised people, especially patients undergoing cancer treatment. Its spores are allergenic and small in size. They enter the body through the respiratory tract. The fungus therefore mainly causes pneumonia. Other important species belong to the order Onygenales, whose members are predominantly common soil saprotrophs. This order nevertheless contains several species which are true virulent pathogens because they are capable of infecting healthy subjects. However, they are also found naturally as saprotrophs in soils, showing that their parasitism is occasional and probably results from adaptation to their environment, rather than a strategy specific to parasitism. Contamination is also mainly through inhalation of spores and becomes severe rather in immunocompromised patients. The fungus undergoes a dimorphic transition to a yeast form in the human body, as it grows as a filament in nature. Finally, there are many species capable of persisting in the skin or nails where they create athlete's feet, ringworms or onychomycosis.
