### Introduction
The Heterokonta super-phylogeny, also informally called "stramenopiles", has been defined primarily by molecular phylogenies. Together with **[Alveolata]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Alveolata.md %})**
and **[Rhizaria]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Rhizaria.md %})**, it forms a monophyletic group known either by the acronym SAR (Stramenopiles + Alveolata + Rhizaria) or by the name Harosa. They bring together many organism groups that at a glance have little in common. Presumably, this is the group of eukaryotes in which evolution has experienced the greatest number of planes of unicellular and multicellular organization. It is also one of the most successful groups of eukaryotes, which has invaded practically all biotopes. Heterokonta proliferate in marine, freshwater and also terrestrial environments. They have explored many ways of living, since the super-branch contains phagotrophs, fungal-like organisms, algae, as well as parasitic or mutualistic symbionts. Currently known species represent only a small part of their diversity, as metagenomic analyzes have identified more than ten lineages about which nothing is known so far. The phylogeny in Figure 254 therefore only indicates lines for which species have been characterized other than by just metagenomic analyzes.

The Heterokonta are characterized for the most part by the presence at some point in their life cycle of a cell possessing two flagella, the most anterior of which carries mastigonemes in one or two rows (Figure 255). These consist of three parts of distinct diameters and are therefore called tripartite. Mastigonemes consists of proteins and originate from the Golgi apparatus. This heterochronous flagellar apparatus gave them their name. Species that do not have these two flagella form monophyletic subsets nested within groups with the typical two flagella, showing that these are secondary losses. All Heterokonta analyzed have tubular crested mitochondria. Some groups are protected by siliceous envelopes or skeletons called thecae (sing. theca), such as diatoms (Bacillariophyta) or Dictyochophyta. The accumulation of these siliceous structures forms an important part of sediments and is used by paleontologists for dating and studies of fossil biotopes. These various "theca" or envelopes make it possible to date the appearance of the Heterokonta to more than 700 million years in the past.

At the base of the evolutionary tree is the branch with _Platysulcus tardus_, a small flagellate possessing the flagellar apparatus typical of Heterokonta, except that the mastigonemes appear to be bipartite (Figure 256). The tree is then currently subdivided into three major branches, the Sagenista, the Opalinozoa and the Girysta (Figure 254). In all three clades, there are phagotrophs which generally diverge rapidly from other members.

### Sagenista
For the Sagenista, the phagotrophs are the Amphitremidae, amoebae protected by scales or a theca with two openings at opposite poles called pseudostomes (Figure 256). Their pseudopodia are threadlike and can anastomose. A few species harbor chlorella. It is probable that _Sorodiplophrys stercorea_, an amoeba capable of aggregative multicellularity by forming small sorocarps by cell aggregation, finds its phylogenetic placement in this group. The other known Sagenistas form a monophyletic line and have long been considered as atypical fungi, since they feed mainly by osmotrophy, but do not exhibit the other fungal characteristics. In addition, some species can phagocytose bacteria when they transiently differentiate from amoeboid forms. They are common saprotrophs in marine and fresh waters; some species are parasites of animals, algae or plants, the best known of which are _Labyrinthula terrestris_ which causes damage in heavily watered golf courses and _Labyrinthula zosterae_ which killed, a few years ago, most of the Eelgrass from the North American coast of the Pacific Ocean that served as food for ducks, leading to their starvation and great reduction in numbers. The group is characterized by the presence of a particular structure, the bothrosome (Figure 257). This bothrosome makes it possible to secrete an original "ectoplasmic" network lined with "plasma" membranes. Basal plaque appears to act in the retention of organelles in the cell body. The ectoplasmic network nevertheless seems to have the capacity to secrete various molecules. Thraustochytrida (Figure 258) are unicellular and use this network from a single bothrosome like rhizoids to degrade the organic matter on which they proliferate. Their life cycle is simple with a trophic phase that superficially resembles that of [Chytridiomycota](/Microbial-eukaryotes/book/Part2/phylogenetic_classification/sections/Eumycota.html#zoosporic-fungi) (Figure 258).
