Oceans cover two-thirds of the earth's surface. Their productivity depends on the latitude which influences the amount of light received and the temperature of the water. The latter modulates the amount of carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen and therefore the efficiency of photosynthesis and respiration because cold water dissolves these two gases better. The availability of mineral salts such as iron, phosphate and that of nitrogen in a form that can be assimilated by eukaryotic algae such as nitrate are also parameters that will strongly affect primary productivity. They will depend on the proximity of the continents and ascending or descending sea currents. In general, the productivity of waters at extreme latitudes is greater than that of tropical and equatorial waters, although there is less light there. This is easily seen by their turbidity: warm waters are generally crystal clear, indicative of low biomass. In contrast, temperate and cold waters are very opaque due to the micro-plankton present. Carbon fixation in marine ecosystems is also strongly modulated by the many species that manufacture calcium carbonate tests, such as Haptophyte "coccoliths" or Foraminifera. Calcium carbonate dissolves at depth, and in present-day seas disappears below 4,500 meters deep. Nevertheless, the mineralization of the tests participates in the precipitation of carbon in the sediments and therefore in the global carbon cycle. The return of carbon but also of other elements necessary for metabolism (phosphate, nitrate, mineral salts, etc.) in the pool available for primary producers is done by consumers, parasites and viruses.

Traditionally, marine ecosystems have been dissociated into five major types: the shallow pelagic ocean, the deep ocean, the ocean floor with warm hydrothermal areas and the rest of the cold benthic and coastal areas (Figure 354).

The shallow pelagic ocean is the area of the oceans that receives light, called the photic zone, and in which most of the marine photosynthetic activity occurs. Its depth depends on the turbidity of the water and does not exceed 200 meters deep in the high seas. It is therefore a very shallow layer, but which will concentrate a large fraction of the oceanic biomass. High throughput sequencing analysis of planktonic organisms shows that in superficial pelagic ecosystems the biodiversity of eukaryotic protists is much greater than that of animals. However, the Eumycota are not very diverse there compared to terrestrial ecosystems. Instead, protozoa and microalgae, but also many parasites are responsible for the great diversity.
