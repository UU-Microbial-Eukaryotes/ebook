title: The phylogenetic classification of eukaryotes
---
The phylogenetic classification of eukaryotes Molecular phylogenies (Figure 81) currently require regrouping most eukaryotes in the form of six monophyletic lines, Opisthokonta, Amoebozoa, Achaeplastida, Heterokonta, Alveolata and Rhizaria, from an ensemble probably polyphyletic, the "Hacrobia", and a last group whose status is in constant modification, the "Excavata". The six semblent monophyletic lines solidarity establishments and will probably not change more. On the contrary, it is very likely that Excavata disappears, because most of the species of this group have not been molecularly analyzed. Data already obtained suggest that this line is polyphyletic.
